WhatsApp Web photos downloader extension 

I have encountered this problem in my work many times (sometimes I need to download 100 consecutive images), so I created a browser extension that helps (to some extent) solve the issue.
All this tool I created does is click the left arrow every 3 seconds, which allows each image to be downloaded individually on the same page, and then a "Download All" button will appear.
The time interval between each image depends on the date of sending or receiving the set of images you want to download, and you can manually adjust that in the extension based on your download speed as well.
How to install the extension:
Download the compressed file and extract it.
Go to the three dots in the corner of the browser, then select "Extensions," and then "Manage Extensions."
Enable "Developer Mode," then choose "Load Unpacked Extension."
Select the folder you extracted.
